summary: Network ecology is an emerging field of study describing species interactions (e.g., predation, pollination, and parasitism) in a biological community. Ecological networks are at the core of the functioning and stability of our environment, and their emergent structure is the result of many ecological and evolutionary processes. Under the very scarce data regime characterizing network ecology, predicting the emergent structure of ecological networks is an important task that would make the large-scale analysis of ecological networks accessible. In this talk, I will show how to predict the total number of interactions in food webs using a beta-binomial model. This model outperforms all previous attempts to predict the number of interactions in food webs while respecting biological constraints. I will then show how to use this model and the principle of maximum entropy to predict other aspects of food-web structure, with a strong emphasis on the degree distribution. I will conclude my presentation with potential applications of this method, including the simulation of the impacts of climate change and habitat loss on the structure of ecological networks.
